== Version 0.4.0:

This version focuses on being more "distribution friendly". It adds mechanisms to add and remove
dependencies, either temporarily or persistently, between services without manual editing of
service description files.

Changes:
 * A new service description directive, "waits-for.d", allows specifying a directory for which the
   contents (filenames) are read as dependencies. This provides a convenient way to add and remove
   dependencies to service descriptions without editing the textual service description file. 
 * dinitctl has new commands, "add-dep" and "rm-dep", to add or remove a dependency between
   services. The dependency is not persisted and won't survive a restart. Check the man page for
   details.
 * dinitctl has new commands, "enable" and "disable". These permanently enable/disable
   a service for some target ("boot" by default) by creating/destroying a symbolic link
   in the waits-for.d directory specified in the service description (and create/remove
   waits-for dependency dynamically). Check the man page for details.
 * A code style guide has been added (in the "doc" directory).
 * More tests, minor bugfixes.
