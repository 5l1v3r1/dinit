== Version 0.5.0:

This version adds S6-compatible readiness notification support, and adds support for updating
the "utmp" database when services start/stop (this functionality should be avoided if possible
since the "utmp" database is mostly an historical artifact, and system support is often prone
to issues which allow unprivileged users to prevent updates and deny or delay logins; however,
utilities such as "who" may depend on the database being updated appropriately). 

Other changes:
 * Add "-u" command line option to force running dinit as a user instance.
 * Add a "chain-to" service property to better support recovery services.
 * Add a "shares-console" service option to allow running services "on the console" without having
   them own it exclusively.
 * Add "inittab-id" and "inittab-line" service settings for utmp support.
 * Minor bugfixes.

== Version 0.4.0:

This version focuses on being more "distribution friendly". It adds mechanisms to add and remove
dependencies, either temporarily or persistently, between services without manual editing of
service description files.

Changes:
 * A new service description directive, "waits-for.d", allows specifying a directory for which the
   contents (filenames) are read as dependencies. This provides a convenient way to add and remove
   dependencies to service descriptions without editing the textual service description file. 
 * dinitctl has new commands, "add-dep" and "rm-dep", to add or remove a dependency between
   services. The dependency is not persisted and won't survive a restart. Check the man page for
   details.
 * dinitctl has new commands, "enable" and "disable". These permanently enable/disable
   a service for some target ("boot" by default) by creating/destroying a symbolic link
   in the waits-for.d directory specified in the service description (and create/remove
   waits-for dependency dynamically). Check the man page for details.
 * A code style guide has been added (in the "doc" directory).
 * More tests, minor bugfixes.
