Contributing to Dinit's development
===================================

At the time of writing there have been only minimal outside contributions, but I'm writing this
contribution guide in readiness for contributions being made by other persons.


Code contributions
------------------

In general, code contributions:
 - should follow existing style and conventions
 - should keep the design considerations in mind (read the DESIGN document)
 - should be accompanied by appropriate documentation additions/updates
 - should include tests where practical

As the maintainer and original author, I maintain the right to reject or request modification to
contributions, for failure to comply with the points listed above, for failure to adhere to a
reasonable standard of conduct (see Contributor Conduct below), or because I deem that the
contribution includes features outside the intended scope. Feel free to contact me to sound
out whether I would be likely to accept a submission for a particular feature.

Contributors should feel free to create (or add themselves to) a CONTRIBUTORS list as part of
the patch/pull request.

I will endeavour to respond to all offered contributions with civility and respect, even if I
choose not to accept them.


Contributor Conduct
-------------------

There is no complete "code of conduct" for Dinit contributors, but contributions will only be
accepted from those who are civil and respectful towards others. Specific behaviours that won't
be tolerated from contributors include but are not limited to:

 - discrimination generally, and especially if based on race, gender or gender identity, sexual
   preference, etc
 - personal attacks, insults, or harassment, or incitement thereof, against others
 - unnecessarily drawing attention to another's personal issues or conditions, or other personal
   details

If a person is deemed to have engaged in negative behaviour such as from the list above,
contributions from them will not be accepted and the perpetrator may be blocked from
communications related to Dinit development. Note that such negative behaviours need not have
occurred in a public forum, and need not be related to Dinit development.

In short: don't be nasty to others; arseholes won't be tolerated.

If you feel that a contributor has behaved inappropriately, please feel free to contact me to
discuss it; such communication will be kept confidential (unless and until otherwise agreed).
