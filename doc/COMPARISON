Comparison of Dinit with other supervision / init systems
=========================================================

This is intended to be an objective description of the differences between
Dinit and several other similar software packages. Due to a myriad of details,
it is difficult to provide a very meaningful comparison without going into
great detail (which this document does not). It does, however, serve as a
short survey of service supervision and init systems, and provides a starting
point for understanding the unique features of Dinit.


Systems without dependency management
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A variety of init/supervision packages do not perform proper dependency management
of supervisions. By this I mean that, broadly speaking:
 - starting a service should automatically start any services that the former
   requires (and wait, if appropriate, until they have started)
 - likewise, stopping a service should automatically stop any dependent services.

Dinit (and various other packages) perform dependency management. The following
packages do not:

 * Daemontools (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html)
 * Epoch (http://universe2.us/epoch.html)
 * Finit (http://github.com/troglobit/finit)
 * Minit (http://www.fefe.de/minit)
 * Perp (http://b0llix.net/perp/)
 * Runit (http://smarden.org/runit/)


Cinit (http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cinit)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
An obscure init system which apparently offers portability and dependency
management, just as Dinit does. Development appears to have ceased some
time ago, unfortunately.


InitNG (http://initng.org/trac)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
A highly modular init system which apparently offers dependency management
(as Dinit does). Portability status is unclear; may be Linux-only (Dinit
strives for portability). Development may have ceased (website is now showing
Japanese text which I am unable to read) although there are what looks like
maintenance commits in the Github repository at https://github.com/initng/initng.


Nosh (http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/Softwares/nosh.html)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Another seemingly modular init system offering dependency management and socket
activation, with BSD licensing. Service configuration is expressed through
directory structure (symbolic links represent service dependencies, etc). It
provides a simple shell-like scripting language which can be used to describe
how to start services (and to control resource limits etc).

It was originally designed for BSD systems but works on Linux too (i.e. is
portable). It does not provide a D-Bus interface. Seemingly, this package addresses
most of the various complaints that have been levelled against SystemD. Compared to
Dinit, it favors chain-loading of smaller utilities to provide even more basic
functionality. By comparison Dinit tends to avoid starting additional processes by
design, expresses configuration in files and tracks state internally.

Nosh seems to be a quite mature system with a range of features that makes it
appear competitive, feature-wise, with Systemd, though without a lot of the
feature-creep extras that can easily be implemented separately.


OpenRC (Gentoo)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The OpenRC system used in Gentoo Linux is a dependency-managing service supervision
system with functionality that may similar in some respects to Dinit. According to
Wikipedia, it provides parallel startup of services (like Dinit).

It is difficult to find high-level documentation regarding the operation of OpenRC.
It seems that services must be specified via a shell script, and service
configuration (eg to specify dependencies) is also specified as part of the script.

Although the build system seems to have some support for BSD OSes, it did not
build successfully on OpenBSD when tested (revision 33d3f33).


S6-RC (http://skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/s6-rc.html)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
S6-RC provides a dependency-management system over the top of the S6 supervision
system. Apparently it maintains most state on disk. S6-RC requires compiling the
complete set of service descriptions into a database. New services cannot be added
once the system is in operation, and service definitions cannot be changed in
general, except by re-compiling the database; S6-RC will then start any new
services as required (and stop any processes no longer considered part of an
active service).

S6 in general seems to follow the philosophy of breaking up functionality into smaller
parts and implementing these smaller parts as separate programs, wherever
practical. Thus, process supervision, log file management, and service management
are all separate programs.

In contrast, Dinit does not requires compiling service definitions, instead
loading and parsing them on-the-fly. Also, Dinit incorporates service
supervision and management into a single process. Some people may see
the more modularised nature of S6/S6-RC as an advantage of that system; I
personally feel that Dinit's one-process approach is not particularly
problematic and that the various functionality it provides is closely enough
related that splitting it into component processes would not be beneficial -
However, I can understand the other viewpoint.

S6-RC nicely manages chaining of service standard input/output, facilitating
setting up a logging chain where a logging process consumes the output of a
service, and either can be restarted while losing only minimal (if any)
output from the logs.

It appears that S6 supports only hard dependencies: that is if, a service depends
on another then that service must start, and stay running. Dinit supports a number
of dependency types including "soft" dependencies which allow the dependency to
stop or fail without necessarily stopping the dependent.


Systemd
-=-=-=-
Systemd is probably the most widely used init system on Linux as of the last year
or two. Compared to Dinit:
 - Systemd provides a range of functionality not provided by Dinit, such as:
   - setting priority and various other attributes of the service process that
     Dinit does not support [yet].
   - seat/session management
   - syslogd replacement (or at least, partial replacement)
   - ability to run tasks at certain times
   - inetd replacement (lazily launch services to handle connection to IP ports)
   - asynchronous filesystem check/mount
   - control group (cgroup) / container management
   - private tmp directories for services / login sessions
   - system time management
   Some of this functionality can be found in other daemons/packages which can be
   be used to supplement the functionality of Dinit.
 - Systemd running in "system" mode does not properly support running with a PID
   other than 1 [1]. That is, it must replace /sbin/init. Systemd can however be run in
   "user" mode where it (most likely) provides the same or greater level of functionality
   as Dinit, though in a more complex package.
 - Systemd exposes a D-Bus API. Dinit eschews D-Bus in favor of a compact custom protocol.
 - Systemd makes no attempt to be portable to operating system kernels other than
   Linux. The maintainers consider it infeasible to port to non-Linux-based OSes
   and will refuse patches designed to do so [2]. Dinit, by comparison, strives to be
   portable.

Upstart (Ubuntu; http://upstart.ubuntu.com)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Upstart does not provide real dependency management; instead "events" (including services
starting or stopping) can be specified to trigger start/stop of other services. This is
backwards from the Dinit approach (and that taken by most dependency-managing supervision
systems) which allow the dependencies of a service to be specified declaratively. That is,
if service A depends on service B, Upstart is configured so as to start B whenever A starts
(and it's not possible, or at least not trival, to start A without also starting B).

Upstart apparently offers a D-Bus interface. Dinit eschews D-Bus in favour of a simple
custom control protocol.
