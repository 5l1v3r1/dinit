Comparison of Dinit with other supervision / init systems
=========================================================

This is intended to be an objective description of the differences between Dinit
and several other similar software packages.


OpenRC (Gentoo)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The OpenRC system used in Gentoo Linux is a dependency-managing service supervision
system with funcionality similar in some respects to Dinit. It provides parallel
startup of services (like Dinit). Compared to Dinit:
 - OpenRC is configured using, and relies largely on, shell scripts
 - OpenRC cannot be used as a direct replacement for /sbin/init; instead it is
   intended that OpenRC be started by init.
 - Although the build system seems to have some support for BSD OSes, it did not
   build successfully on OpenBSD when tested (revision 33d3f33).


Systemd
-=-=-=-
Systemd is probably the most widely used init system on Linux as of the last year
or two. Compared to Dinit:
 - Systemd provides a range of functionality not provided by Dinit, such as:
   - setting UID, priority, and other attributes of the service process. Dinit does
     not support this yet.
   - seat/session management
   - syslogd replacement (or at least, partial replacement)
   - ability to run tasks at certain times
   - inetd replacement (lazily launch services to handle connection to IP ports)
   - asynchronous filesystem check/mount
   - control group (cgroup) / container management
   - system time management
   Some of this functionality can be found in other daemons/packages which can be
   be used to supplement the functionality of Dinit.
 - Systemd running in "system" mode does not properly support running with a PID
   other than 1 [1]. That is, it must replace /sbin/init. Systemd can however be run in
   "user" mode where it (most likely) provides the same level of functionality of
   Dinit, though in a more complex package.
 - Systemd exposes a D-Bus API.
 - Systemd makes no attempt to be portable to operating system kernels other than
   Linux. The maintainers consider it infeasible to port to non-Linux-based OSes
   and will refuse patches designed to do so [2]. Dinit, by comparison, strives to be
   portable.
