Dinit
-----
v0.03 (pre-release)


What is it?
=-=-=-=-=-=

"Dinit" is a service supervisor with dependency support which can also
act as the system "init" program.

Specifically it can launch multiple services (generally, "daemon" processes,
but see notes below) in parallel, with dependency management (i.e. if one
service's operation depends on another, the latter service will be started
first).

For "process" services Dinit can monitor the process corresponding to the
service, and re-start it if it dies. It does this in an intelligent way,
first "rolling back" all dependent services, and restarting them when their
dependencies are satisfied.

Dinit includes a tool ("dinitctl") to issue commands to the main Dinit
process, and a "shutdown" program (with scripts "halt" and "reboot") to
manage shutting down and restarting the system.

Dinit is designed to work on POSIXy operating systems such as Linux and
OpenBSD. It is written in C++ and uses the "Dasynq" event handling library,
which was written especially to support Dinit.

Development goals include clean design, robustness, portability, and
avoiding feature bloat (whilst still handling a variety of use cases).

Introduction to services
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A "service" is nominally a persistent process or system state. The two main
types of service are a _process_ service (represented by a an actual process)
and a _scripted_ service (which is started and stopped by running a process -
often a shell script - to completion). There are also _bgprocess_ services
and _internal_services.

Many programs that you might want to run under dinit's supervision can run
either "in the foreground" or as a daemon ("in the background"), and the
choice is dictated by a command line switch (for instance the -D and -F
switches to Samba's "smbd"). Although it might seem counterintuitive,
the "foreground" mode should be used for programs registered as process
services in dinit; this allows dinit to monitor the process.

Process services are attractive due to the ease of monitoring (and
restarting) the service, however, they have one inherent problem, which is
that dinit cannot tell when the service is truly started. Once the process
has been launched, dinit assumes that the service has started, but in fact
there will be a short delay before the process sets itself up, starts
listening on sockets, etc; during this time any other process (including
one from a service listed as dependent) which tries to contact it will not
be able to do so. In practice, this is not usually a problem (and external
solutions, like D-Bus, do exist).

A _scripted_ service has separate commands for startup and (optional)
shutdown. Scripted services can be used for tasks such as mounting file
systems that don't need a persisten process, and in some cases can be used
for daemon processes (although Dinit will not be able to supervise a
process that is registered as a scripted service).

A _bgprocess_ service is a mix between a process service and a scripted
service. A command is used to start the service, and once started, the
process ID is expected to be available in a file which Dinit can then
read. Many existing daemons can operate in this way. Dinit can only supervise
the process if it runs as the system "init" (PID 1) - otherwise Dinit will
not know when the process has terminated.

(Note, use of bgprocess services type requires care. The file from which the
PID is read is trusted; Dinit may send signals to the specified PID. It
should not be possible for unauthorised users to modify the file contents!)

An _internal_ service is just a placeholder service that can be used to
describe a set of dependencies. An internal service has no corresponding
process.


Service Hiearchy and states
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Services can depend on other services for operation, and so form a
dependency hierarchy. Starting a service which depends on another
causes that other service to start (and the first service waits until
the latter has started before its process is launched and it is itself
considered started).

Services are considered _active_ when they are not stopped. Services
can also be explicitly marked as active (this normally happens when you
explicitly start a service). Finally, a service with an active dependent
is also considered active.

If a service stops and becomes inactive (i.e. it is not explicitly marked
active and has no active dependents) then any services it depends on will
also be marked inactive and stopped unless they have other active
dependents, or were explicitly started and marked active.

What this means is that, in general, starting an (inactive, stopped)
service and then stopping it will return the system to its prior state -
no dependencies which were started automatically will be left running.


Service Description files
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Dinit discovers services by reading _service description files_. These files
reside in a directory (/etc/dinit.d is the default "system" location) and
their name matches the name of the service. Service descriptions are loaded
lazily, as needed by Dinit.

A service description file consists of a number of parameter settings.
Settings in the SDF are denoted as a parameter name followed by either an
equal sign or colon and then the parameter value (all on the same line).
Comments begin with a hash mark (#) and extend to the end of the line (they
must be separated from setting values by at least one whitespace character).

Parameter values are interpreted literally, except that:
 - whitespace is collapsed to a single space
 - double quotes can be used around all or part(s) of a parameter to prevent
   whitespace collapse and interpretation of special characters
 - backslash can be used to 'escape' the next character, preventing any
   special meaning from being associated with it. It can be used to include
   non-collapsing whitespace, double-quote marks, and backslashes in the
   parameter value.

Parameters are:

type = process | bgprocess | scripted | internal
command = ...
logfile = ...
options = ...
depends-on = (service name)
waits-for = (service name)

command = (external script or executable, and arguments)
   For a 'process' service, this is the process to run.
   For a 'scripted' service, this command is run to start the service.

stop-command = (external script or executable, and arguments)
   For a 'scripted' service, this command is run to stop the service.

restart = yes | true | no | false
   Specifies whether the service should automatically restart if it becomes
   stopped (for any reason, including being explicitly requested to stop).
   Only active services will restart automatically.

smooth-recovery = yes | true | no | false
   For process services only. Specifies that, should the process die, it
   can be restarted without bringing the service itself down. This means that
   any dependent services do not need to be stopped/restarted. Such recovery
   happens regardless of the "restart" setting (if smooth-recovery is enabled,
   the service does not reach the stopped state when the process terminates
   unexpectedly).

pid-file = (path to file)
   For "bgprocess" type services only; specifies the path of the file where
   daemon will write its process ID before detaching.

depends-on = (service name)
   This service depends on the named service. Starting this service will
   start the named service; the command to start this service will not be
   executed until the named service has started. If the named service is
   stopped then this service will also be stopped.

waits-for = (service name)
   When this service is started, wait for the named service to finish
   starting (or to fail starting) before commencing the start procedure
   for this service. Starting this service will automatically start
   the named service.

socket-listen = (socket path)
   Pre-open a socket for the service and pass it to the service using the
   Systemd activation protocol. This by itself does not give so called
   "socket activation", but does allow that any process trying to connect
   to the specified socket will be able to do so, even before the service
   is properly prepared to accept connections.

socket-permissions = (octal permissions mask)
   Gives the permissions for the socket specified using socket-listen.
   Normally this will be 600 (user access only), 660 (user and group
   access), or 666 (all users).

socket-uid = (numeric user id or username)
   Specifies the user that should own the activation socket. If socket-uid
   is specified without also specifying socket-gid, then the socket group
   is the primary group of the specified user (as found in the system user
   database, normally /etc/passwd). If the socket owner is not specified,
   the socket will be owned by the user id of the Dinit process.

socket-gid = (numeric group id or group name)
   Specifies the group of the activation socket. See discussion of
   socket-uid.

termsignal = HUP | INT | QUIT | USR1 | USR2
   Specifies an additional signal to send to the process when requesting it
   to terminate (applies to 'process' services only). SIGTERM is always
   sent along with the specified signal, unless the 'nosigterm' setting is
   set true.

options = ( runs-on-console | nosigterm | starts-rwfs | starts-log ) ...
  Specifies various options for this service:

  no-sigterm : specifies that the TERM signal should not be send to the
              process to terminate it. (Another signal can be specified using
              the "termsignal" setting; if no other signal is specified, NO
              signal will be sent).

  runs-on-console : specifies that this service uses the console; its input
              and output should be directed to the console. A service running
              on the console prevents other services from running on the
              console (they will queue for the console). For scripted services
              "runs-on-console" applies only during execution of the start
              script.

              The "interrupt" key (normally control-C) will be active for
              process / scripted services that run on the console. This is
              useful to allow filesystem checks to be interrupted/skipped.

  starts-rwfs : this service mounts the root filesystem read/write (or at
              least mounts the normal writable filesystems for the system).
              This prompts Dinit to create its control socket, if it has not
              already managed to do so.

  starts-log : this service starts the system log daemon. Dinit will begin
              logging via the /dev/log socket.
